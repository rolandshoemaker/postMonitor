postMonitor
===========

Basic command-line tool to grab all HTTP requests (`GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, COPY, HEAD` methods, and a few others) and print them rather nicely (if I don't say so myself.)

Todo
----
* Dumping to file / reading dumps
* Shell interface to read dumps / read dump as its happening :o (this might take a while...)

Example
